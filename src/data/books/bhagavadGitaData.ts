          sanskrit: `धृतराष्ट्र उवाच |
धर्मक्षेत्रे कुरुक्षेत्रे समवेता युयुत्सवः |
मामकाः पाण्डवाश्चैव किमकुर्वत सञ्जय ||1||`,
          transliteration: `dhṛitarāśhtra uvācha
dharma-kṣhetre kuru-kṣhetre samavetā yuyutsavaḥ
māmakāḥ pāṇḍavāśhchaiva kimakurvata sañjaya`,
          translation: "Dhritarashtra said: O Sanjay, after gathering on the holy field of Kurukshetra, and desiring to fight, what did my sons and the sons of Pandu do?",
          commentary: `The two armies had gathered on the battlefield of Kurukshetra, well prepared to fight a war that was inevitable. Still, in this verse, King Dhritarashtra asked Sanjay, what his sons and his brother Pandu’s sons were doing on the battlefield? It was apparent that they would fight, then why did he ask such a question?\n\nThe blind King Dhritarashtra’s fondness for his own sons had clouded his spiritual wisdom and deviated him from the path of virtue. He had usurped the kingdom of Hastinapur from the rightful heirs; the Pandavas, sons of his brother Pandu. Feeling guilty of the injustice he had done towards his nephews, his conscience worried him about the outcome of this battle.\n\nThe words dharma kṣhetre, the land of dharma (virtuous conduct) used by Dhritarashtra depict the dilemma he was experiencing. Kurukshetra is described as kurukṣhetraṁ deva yajanam in the Shatapath Brahman, the Vedic textbook detailing rituals. It means “Kurukshetra is the sacrificial arena of the celestial gods.” Hence, it was regarded as the sacred land that nourished dharma.\n\nDhritarashtra feared that the holy land might influence the minds of his sons. If it aroused the faculty of discrimination, they might turn away from killing their cousins and negotiate a truce. A peaceful settlement meant that the Pandavas would continue being a hindrance for them. He felt great displeasure at these possibilities, instead preferred that this war transpires. He was uncertain of the consequences of the war, yet desired to determine the fate of his sons. Therefore, he asked Sanjay about the activities of the two armies on the battleground.`,

          sanskrit: `सञ्जय उवाच ।\nदृष्ट्वा तु पाण्डवानीकं व्यूढं दुर्योधनस्तदा ।\nआचार्यमुपसङ्गम्य राजा वचनमब्रवीत् ।। 2।।`,
          transliteration: `sañjaya uvācha\ndṛiṣhṭvā tu pāṇḍavānīkaṁ vyūḍhaṁ duryodhanastadā\nāchāryamupasaṅgamya rājā vachanamabravīt`,
          translation: "Sanjay said: On observing the Pandava army standing in military formation, King Duryodhan approached his teacher Dronacharya, and said the following words.",
          commentary: `Sanjay understood Dhritarashtra’s concern, who wanted an assurance that the battle would eventuate. Sanjay tried to allay his worry by informing that the Pandava army was standing in a military formation, ready for battle. Then he moved on to tell him what his son Duryodhana was doing on the battlefield.\n\nAs King Dhritarashtra was blind, his eldest son Duryodhana virtually ruled the kingdom of Hastinapur. In the Mahabharata, he is described as very rude, egoistic, evil and cruel by nature. Since his childhood, he had a strong dislike for the Pandavas and left no opportunity to demean them. He was aware that to rule over the entire kingdom of Hastinapur unchallenged he needed to eliminate them. However, standing on the battlefield, when he saw the large Pandava army, he was baffled. He had underestimated the Pandavas, the extent of military might they had gathered was way beyond his expectation.\n\nDuryodhana approached his guru Dronacharya with the pretense of offering respect, but his actual purpose was to palliate his own nervousness. His move towards his guru also reveals that the mammoth military formation of the Pandava army unnerved him and he was now fearful of the outcome of this war.\n\nThe next nine verses are spoken by Duryodhan.`,

          transliteration: `paśhyaitāṁ pāṇḍu-putrāṇām āchārya mahatīṁ chamūm\nvyūḍhāṁ drupada-putreṇa tava śhiṣhyeṇa dhīmatā`,
          translation: "Duryodhan said: Respected teacher! Behold the mighty army of the sons of Pandu, so expertly arrayed for battle by your own gifted disciple, the son of Drupad.",
          commentary: `Duryodhana asked Dronacharya to look at the skillfully arranged military phalanx of the Pandava army led by their commander-in-chief Dhristadyumna, King Dhrupad’s son. He was also one of Dronacharya’s pupils. Duryodhana was subtly reminding his teacher of a mistake he had committed in the past.\n\nMany years back, Dronacharya along with the Pandavas had defeated King Drupad in a battle and took away half his kingdom. To avenge his defeat, Drupad performed a sacrifice to beget a son. Dhristadyumna was born out of that sacrificial fire, with a boon that he would kill Dronacharya in the future. Even though Dronacharya was aware, when he was approached for Dhristadyumna’s military training, he very humbly accepted and imparted all his knowledge impartially to his pupil.\n\nDuryodhana was reminding Dronacharya that even though Dhristadyumna was his pupil, he was also Drupad’s son, with a boon to kill him. He wanted to ensure that as in the past, Dhronacharya should not become lenient towards his pupils, now that, they were on the battlefield.`,

          commentary: "This verse is part of Sanjaya’s narration to King Dhritarashtra, describing the formidable warriors aligned with the Pandavas. Duryodhana, feeling uneasy, lists powerful heroes who are as skilled and strong as Bhima and Arjuna. 'Heroic bowmen' (śūrā maheṣvāsāḥ) implies exceptional archers. Yuyudhana (Satyaki) was a valiant Yadava warrior and Arjuna's disciple. Virata was the king of Matsya who sheltered the Pandavas during exile. Drupada, king of Panchala and father of Draupadi, was also a powerful ally. Each is called a 'mahāratha'—a warrior capable of fighting thousands single-handedly.",

Dhrishtaketu, the king of Chedi and son of Shishupala, is a powerful warrior. Chekitana, a brave Yadava fighter and associate of Krishna, is also present. The king of Kashi (Varanasi) is praised for his valor. Purujit and Kuntibhoja are relatives and loyal supporters of the Pandavas. Shaibya, ruler of the Shibis, is known for his noble character and strength. The phrase 'nara-puṅgavaḥ' (the best among men) honors their superior warrior status.",
